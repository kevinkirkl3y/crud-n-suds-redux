# CRUD 'N' Suds

### "React Fundamentals Project for Epicodus 2.12.21"

#### by Kevin Kirkley

## Description
CRUD N Suds is the newest programming-themed bar in the Portland Area so this project was developed to help the crew manage their ever-changing taplist and track their inventory as pints are sold. This program has full CRUD functionality with the ability to Create, Read, Update and Delete kegs within their system.

## User Stories
* As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent.
* As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
* As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
* As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg.
* As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
* As a user, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
* As a user, I want to be able to delete a keg.
* As a user, I want a keg to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty.
